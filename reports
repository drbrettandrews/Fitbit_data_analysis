# Fitbit User Clustering and Sleep Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Fitbit tracker data to uncover behavioral patterns related to physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep. Using clustering techniques, we segment users into distinct behavior-based groups. Additionally, we apply linear regression to examine how activity and sedentary behavior relate to sleep duration.

## Data Summary

**Source:** [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

The dataset includes detailed activity and sleep records for 30 users over a two-month period. The following files were used:

- `dailyActivity_merged.csv` – Daily step counts, distance, and activity levels
- `sleepDay_merged.csv` – Total sleep duration in minutes

Note: Heart rate data was excluded from this analysis for performance and relevance reasons in this phase of the project.

## Clustering Analysis

We performed k-means clustering to group users based on three features:

- Total daily steps (`TotalSteps`)
- Total sedentary minutes (`SedentaryMinutes`)
- Total minutes asleep (`TotalMinutesAsleep`)

### Methodology

1. Selected features were scaled using the `scale()` function.
2. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method (`fviz_nbclust()`), with k = 3 selected for modeling.
3. Clustering was performed using `kmeans()` with 25 random starts for reproducibility.

### Cluster Profiles

| Cluster | Average Steps | Average Sedentary Minutes | Average Sleep Minutes | Number of Users |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1       | 5,607          | 951                        | 267                    | 62               |
| 2       | 11,596         | 701                        | 400                    | 205              |
| 3       | 5,497          | 627                        | 511                    | 146              |

**Interpretation:**

- **Cluster 1** appears to be sedentary and sleep-deprived.
- **Cluster 2** represents highly active users with moderate sleep.
- **Cluster 3** includes moderately active individuals who sleep the most.

## Sleep Prediction via Linear Regression

A multiple linear regression model was trained to predict `TotalMinutesAsleep` using the following predictors:

- `TotalSteps`
- `SedentaryMinutes`

### Model Summary

- **Formula:** `TotalMinutesAsleep ~ TotalSteps + SedentaryMinutes`
- **Intercept:** 783.47
- **TotalSteps coefficient:** -0.0074
- **SedentaryMinutes coefficient:** -0.425
- **R-squared:** 0.3962
- **RMSE:** 93.65 minutes

### Interpretation

- Higher daily step counts are associated with slightly lower sleep durations.
- Increased sedentary time is also negatively correlated with sleep.
- The model explains approximately 40% of the variance in sleep duration.

This suggests that neither physical activity nor sedentary time alone are strong predictors of how much sleep a user gets, highlighting the need for more nuanced behavioral or physiological variables.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of clustering techniques in segmenting wearable device users by behavior. It also provides a foundation for predictive modeling using simple activity metrics. Future iterations of this project may include:

- Incorporating heart rate or intensity metrics
- Using time series data for trend analysis
- Exploring nonlinear or ensemble regression models
